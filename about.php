				<h5>Web Developer</h5>
				<p class ="animation">I am an allround web developer.
					 I am a junior programmer with good knowledge of front-end techniques. 
					 I love structure and order and I also stand for quality. 
					 I love spending time on fixing little details and optimizing web apps. 
					 Also I like working in a team, you'll learn faster and much more.
					 As the saying goes: 'two heads are better than one'.</p>
